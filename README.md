Welcome to MapRoulette, the powerful & popular bug fixing tool (or is it a game?) for OpenStreetMap.

This README deals with development related topics only. If you are interested in contributing to OpenStreetMap by fixing some bugs through MapRoulette, just head over to [the MapRoulette web site](http://maproulette.org) and get started - it should be pretty self explanatory.

That said, read on if you want to contribute to MapRoulette development and are ready to deploy your local instance.

## Contributing

Please fork the project and submit pull requests. But before you do, unless your fix is something really minor, please get in touch so we can discuss.

See the code style conventions at https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette/wiki/Code-style-conventions *needs updating*

### Frameworks used

MapRoulette relies heavily on the lightweight Flask web application framework, and some of its extensions, notably Flask-OAuth, Flask-RESTful, Flask-Script, and Flask-SQLAlchemy. For working with geospatial data, MapRoulette relies on GeoAlchemy2 and Shapely.

## Deploying MapRoulette

If you want to deploy your own live MapRoulette server, see the documentation [here](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette/wiki/Maproulette-Instance-Quickstart-Guide).

If you want to set up MapRoulette locally for testing and development, and you want to benefit from the built-in debugging features of Flask, follow [these](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette/wiki/Run-A-MapRoulette-Development-Server-Locally) steps.

MapRoulette requires Python 3.5 or higher.

## Creating new Challenges
Ceating and maintaining a good challenge is a little more complex than just pushing a button. It's not too difficult though. For a gentle introduction, please see [this workshop at SOTM EU](http://sotm-eu.org/en/slots/39) and [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bl0WJ3iBjMH0AwTsOPu8sHeaInd1w-KXk_QXaEFSVFo/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.

## Contact

Bug and feature requests are best left as an issue right here on Github. For other things, contact maproulette@maproulette.org

MapRoulette now also has its very own [Slack community](http://maproulette.slack.com). Invite yourself [here](https://maproulette-slack-selfinvite.herokuapp.com)!
